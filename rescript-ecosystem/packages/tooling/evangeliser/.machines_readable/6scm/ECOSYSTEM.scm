  (what-this-is
    "A pattern detection engine, CLI tool, and narrative generator that scans JavaScript code, identifies 52 patterns across 21 categories amenable to ReScript transformation, and explains improvements using encouraging celebrate/minimize/better narratives with Makaton-inspired visual glyphs")

  (what-this-is-not
    "Not a transpiler (does not convert JS to ReScript automatically). Not a linter (does not enforce coding standards). Not a build tool (does not compile or bundle code). Not a language server (yet)."))
