== What is Developer Ecosystem?

*Developer Ecosystem* is the central hub for all development workflow tools—git operations, repository management, scaffolding, and developer experience.

This primary brings together projects that improve how developers:

* *Git Tools* — Forge management, branch workflows, repo unification
* *Repo Management* — Automation, analysis, health monitoring
* *Scaffolding* — Project templates, boilerplate generation
* *Developer UX* — IDE extensions, documentation tools, reconciliation

== Git Tools

Repositories focused on Git operations across multiple forges (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, Bitbucket).

=== gitvisor

A hyper-customizable dashboard for unified Git platform management.
Starting with GitHub and GitLab integration, expanding to become the definitive interface for developers who demand control.

=== gitloom

Git workflow weaving and branch management.
Advanced branch operations with safety guarantees.

=== git-reunify

Safe repo reunification tool—merge diverged repos without losing work.
Handles developer reconciliation scenarios where repos have drifted apart.

=== git-seo

Make your Git repositories discoverable with SEO optimization tools.
Metadata, descriptions, and tagging for better findability.

=== polysafe-gitfixer

A polyglot implementation of a git backup merger tool.
Each component written in the language providing the strongest safety guarantees for that concern.

=== vext

High-performance IRC notification daemon for version control systems.
Real-time commit notifications from Git repos to IRC channels with connection pooling.

== Repo Management

Repositories focused on automated repository analysis, health monitoring, and maintenance.

=== oikos

*Ecological & Economic Code Analysis Platform*

_οἶκος_ (oikos): the shared Greek root of ecology and economy.

Features:
* Carbon intensity scoring
* Sustainability metrics
* Pareto-optimal code health
* GitHub/GitLab integration

=== robot-repo-automaton

Automated repository management bot.
Handles routine maintenance, updates, and health checks.

=== grim-repo

Modular audit-grade tooling for narratable, scaffolded, and legible repositories.
Ensures repos meet quality and documentation standards.

=== robot-vacuum-cleaner

A comprehensive, production-grade robot vacuum cleaner simulation system.
Includes repository tidying capabilities.

== Scaffolding

Repositories focused on project template generation and structure.

=== scaffoldia

A developer-centred, modular, and community-driven repo scaffolding engine.

* Generates idiomatic, validated, narratable project structures
* Supports multiple languages, tools, and themes
* Audience-aware stance configuration

== Developer UX

Repositories focused on improving the developer experience.

=== rescript-evangeliser

"Celebrate good, minimize bad, show better"

A VS Code extension that teaches JavaScript developers ReScript through progressive code transformation, without shame.

=== recon-silly-ation

Documentation Reconciliation System.

Automatically reconcile, deduplicate, and resolve conflicts in Git repository documentation using:
* Content-addressable storage
* Graph-based conflict resolution

=== nickel-config-reporter

Ingests config files, clones to Nickel format, emits AsciiDoc audit reports.

== Relationship to Other Primaries

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Primary | Relationship

| *rhodium-standard-repositories*
| RSR compliance standards for developer-ecosystem satellites

| *poly-mcps*
| poly-git-mcp uses developer-ecosystem git tools

| *neural-foundations*
| oikos uses AI for code analysis (neurosymbolic potential)

| *cccp*
| Language policy governs all implementations
|===

== Notable Standalone Projects

Some developer tools remain standalone due to their unique nature:

* *valence-shell* — Reversible thermodynamic shell (fundamental paradigm shift)
* *cicd-hyper-a* — Reusable CI/CD templates (infrastructure, not tooling)

== Contributing

Contributions should focus on *developer workflow improvements*:

1. Git forge integrations
2. Repository analysis algorithms
3. Scaffolding templates
4. Developer experience enhancements
