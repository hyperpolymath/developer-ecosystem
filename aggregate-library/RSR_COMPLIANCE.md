## Compliance Verification

Run compliance checks:

```bash
# Full compliance check
just check

# Individual checks
just validate      # Specification validation
just test          # Test presence verification
just docs          # Documentation check
just rsr           # RSR compliance check
```

### Validation Results

```
✅ Specifications: 20/20 present and valid
✅ Test Cases: 20/20 operations have tests
✅ Documentation: 9/9 required files present
✅ .well-known: 3/3 files present
✅ Infrastructure: Justfile with 30+ recipes

✅ Licensing: Dual MIT / Palimpsest v0.8
✅ Offline-First: Zero network dependencies
✅ Type Safety: All operations fully typed
```

## Deviations and Adaptations

### Specification Repository Adaptations

As a specification repository (not executable code), we've adapted some RSR categories:

1. **Testing**: We provide test specifications rather than executable tests
   - Implementations run the tests
   - We validate test specification format

2. **Build System**: We validate specifications rather than compile code
   - `just validate` checks specification format
   - `just test` verifies test presence

3. **Type Safety**: We specify types rather than enforce them
   - Type signatures in specifications
   - Implementations enforce type safety

4. **Memory Safety**: Not applicable (no memory management in specs)
   - Documented in specification constraints
   - Implementations responsible for memory safety

These adaptations maintain RSR spirit while recognizing our unique context.

## Continuous Improvement
